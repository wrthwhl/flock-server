_**Planning a trip with your friends has never been easier.**
Flock allows you to have a well structured discussion with your friends to build a consensus for your next group holiday. In full-democracy mode every member of a trip can make and vote for suggestions in three categories: destination, budget and timing. You can also choose to dictate any of these categories. As creator of the group you can lock the voting and discussion down any time._
